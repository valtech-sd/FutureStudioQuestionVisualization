### The Science and the Method

InfraNodus is a non-commercial [venture fiction](https://noduslabs.com/research/venture-fiction/) project. Its main objective is to enhance perception and imagination, although it can also solve concrete problems and offer you an efficient way to retain, process, and make sense of information. It can:

* Help researchers make sense of textual data
* Help you retain and remember information
* Help you connect disjointed bits and pieces of data
* Visualize patterns in complex relations
* Be used for text network analysis
* Be used to quickly create graphs using text / voice input
* Perform comparative visual analysis of texts
* Identify the structure of discourse (dispersed / biased)
* Reveal the gaps in a network (and, thus, the potential for new ideas/connections)
* Provide network metrics, identify the main communities and top nodes

The method is mainly based on the approach outlined in Paranyushkin (2011) **[Identifying the Pathways of Meaning Circulation Using Text Network Analysis](https://noduslabs.com/research/pathways-meaning-circulation-text-network-analysis/)**.

A more precise description of InfraNodus' algorithm is presented in Paranyushkin (2019) **[InfraNodus — Generating Insight Using Text Network Analysis](http://bit.ly/infragitpdf)** (published in the [Proceedings for the WWW'19 The Web Conference](http://bit.ly/infragitacm)). If you use the tool, you can cite this paper.

A more easy-to-read article on the tool is published in **[Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/measuring-discourse-bias-using-text-network-analysis-9f251be5f6f3)**.

### Introduction

The basic ideas behind InfraNodus are:

- [Graph DB model](https://github.com/deemeetree/graphdbmodel) suitable for large graphs and collaboration.
- Represent text as a network of interconnected nodes.
- Works on desktop and mobile.
- Make it easy to add nodes into a graph through a simple web interface.
- Work with what people already know and use well: #hashtags and @mentions, not nodes and edges.
- Use natural language to enter nodes in a graph (English and Russian morphology is supported)
- Move away from binary edges (e.g. A < - > B) to hyperedges in one statement (e.g. A and B and C or D)
- API and JSON export of all data;
- Twitter, Evernote, Gmail, Google, YouTube subtitles, RSS import (TODO: gexf, xml, csv upload)
- Enable people to use ше collaboratively, both locally and over the internet
- Your suggestions? (open an issue)

### Installation Guide

#### Run on the cloud
To run InfraNodus on the cloud, go to [www.infranodus.com](https://infranodus.com). 


#### Run directly on your machine
To use this software you should install Neo4J 3.0 on your local computer.
To install Neo4J on a Mac use homebrew (see [Neo4J instructions here](http://www.neo4j.org/download)).
For settings, check out [How to Set Up Neo4J for InfraNodus](https://github.com/noduslabs/infranodus/wiki/Neo4J-Database-Setup).
You may also find [other wiki pages](https://github.com/noduslabs/infranodus/wiki/_pages) interesting, especially [Neo4J installation guide](https://github.com/noduslabs/infranodus/wiki/Upgrading-Your-Neo4J-Database-from-2.x-to-3.x) – the section on setting up indexes and installing APOC plugin.

Git clone this project into a folder, then you will also need to have npm Node.Js package manager installed on your computer. After you install InfraNodus, run

`npm install`

in the main folder the project to install all the dependencies into `node_modules` folder.

Check out the `config.json.sample` file and edit it to add your own Evernote and Twitter API credentials. 
Then rename it to `config.json`.
Create `statsabove.ejs`, `statsbelow.ejs` and `statsheader.ejs` files in the `/views` folder.

Run the application with 
`node app.js` 

You can access the app from http://localhost:3000

To create an account on your local machine, visit http://localhost:3000/signup?invitation=secretcode - replace `secretcode` with the value of `secrets.invitation` in your `config.json`.

### Data Model

The general rationale for the data model used in InfraNodus is outlined in
* [Cognitive Network Protocol](http://noduslabs.com/research/cognitive-network-protocol/) article (more specific)
* [From Cognitive Interfaces to Transcendental Protocols](http://noduslabs.com/research/cognitive-interfaces-transcendental-protocols/) article (more general)
* [Graph Database Model Draft](https://github.com/deemeetree/graphdbmodel) detailed description

The main properties of this model are

- There are 5 labels (types) for nodes: Concepts, Statements, Contexts, Users, and Narratives
- Every expression of a user into the system is a Statement
- Example: "#antibiotics can fight #bacteria which are #dangerous for #health" is the user's input. The system creates 4 :Concept nodes from the hashtags inside the :Statement, which is linked to the :Context (by default, "@private") and all those are attached to the :User.
- Types of connections: :TO (between Concepts), :AT (Concepts to Context), :OF (Concepts to Statement), :IN (Statement to Context), :BY (to User)
- Narrative is implemented through creating a :Narrative node, which is linked to from Statements and Concepts by :INTO type of connection (think of :Narrative as another :Context)
- Narrative elements are linked to each other via :THRU type of connection.

This data model enables to create custom views for any kind of data and introduce the idea of narrative into holistic graph views.

This data model is derived from the [Cognitive Graph DB Model](http://noduslabs.com/cases/graph-database-structure-specification/) draft created by Nodus Labs.

The current data model description utilized in InfraNodus app is available in https://github.com/noduslabs/graphdbmodel repository.

### Python Port

Together with Mattias Östmar (who did most of the work) we created a port of InfraNodus in Python, focusing on the measure of network diversity structure that it provides.

You can get it in [DiscourseDiversity](https://gitlab.com/mattiasostmar/discoursediversity) repo on GitLab. We're still working on it, but if you like Jupyter notebooks and network analysis, there's some good stuff to find in there!
